# CB01_Dev_ESP32S3_BG95

This is the beginnings of a very basic ESP-IDF IDE project that allows the ESP32-S3 to to connect to 
MS-Azure using IOT-Hub and an Quctel BG96/95 modem using PPP.

This project is designed to be loaded into a standard (Non modified) install of "Espressif IDE" (Eclipse with ESP plugins)

And should ideally be cloned into the following folder:

C:\Users\<username>\workspace\

in a folder called "taskingtest"

Any other naming used, will likley require some fidling about with the CMake scripts and other assets in the project
before a successfull compile can be made.
